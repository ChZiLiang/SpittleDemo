SpittleDemo

Spittle,using Springboot,inspired by Spring In Action

本项目基于《Spring 实战》中的Spittle，我觉得这本书对新手来说是非常友好了。这本书有提供源码，我强烈安利。
这个项目受到了书中项目的启发，但相同点应该只有其名字中的“Spittle”了。正好最近在学习Spring与Mybatis的相关知识，我想，学习的过程中利用手头的技术在Spittle的基础上做点什么还是挺有趣的。

项目的构建过程写在SpittleDemo_Introduction.pdf中。

项目仅供个人学习使用。

The project, Spittle, in Spring in Action is wonderful for beginner like me, I think. And it has code provided by the writer. I highly recommand you to read the book and its code.
This project is inspired by the book. But the only same thing will be the name, Spittle. I am trying to figure out how to start a project using SpringBoot and mybatis.So I hope I can use different way (or you can say,technic) to build Spittle.

By the way, if you want to know more, you may find what you need in SpittleDemo_Introduction.pdf .

Have fun.

This project is for personal learning only
